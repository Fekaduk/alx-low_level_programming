Dynamic libraries (also called shared libraries) are linked into the program in two stages. First, during compile time, the linker verifies that all the symbols (again, functions, variables, and the like) required by the program, are either linked into the program or in one of its dynamic libraries. However, the object files from the dynamic library are not inserted into the executable file. Instead, when the program is started, a program in the system (called a dynamic loader) checks out which shared libraries were linked with the program, loads them to memory, and attaches them to the copy of the program in memory.
